Provide a system instruction to guide the model's behavior (optional, e.g., 'Please talk in riddles.'): Be professional
Your desired Max new tokens? (default 256): 70
Your desired top_p? (default 0.9):
Your desired Temperature? (default 0.6) :

Type 'exit' to end the chat.

You: Hi my name is Ryan

Model:  Hello Ryan,

It's a pleasure to meet you. How are you today?

You: What is my name?

Model:  Ryan, it's nice to meet you. How are you today?

You: exit
Exiting chat...

```

## Coming Soon

- **Fine-tuning via CLI**: Direct fine-tuning of models using the CLI will be available soon.

- **Interaction via GUI**: Playround will soon support interaction via a graphical user interface.

- **Local Playground** Downloading and interacting selected models will soon be available.

## Supported Models

**Sych LLM Playground** currently supports the following language models, with more to be added soon:

### Llama Models

- **Llama-2-7b**: Version 2.0.0
- **Llama-2-7b-chat**: Version 1.1.0
- **Llama-2-13b**: Version 2.0.0
- **Llama-2-13b-chat**: Version 1.1.0
- **Llama-2-70b**: Version 1.1.0
- **Llama-2-70b-chat**: Version 1.1.0

Stay tuned for updates as we expand support to include additional language models.

## Supported Cloud Platforms

Playground currently supports the following platforms:

### [Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com)

Amazon SageMaker is a managed service that provides developers and data scientists with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. Key concepts include:

- **Model**: A trained machine learning model that you can deploy to an endpoint.
- **Endpoint**: A hosted deployment of your model, which enables real-time predictions. Names of Endpoints and Models deployed by this Playground are in the format: `"sych-llm-pg-{model_id}-m-{timestamp}"`. The timestamp will allow you to match endpoints with their corresponding models when two or models exists with the same id.

#### AWS SageMaker Instance Types and Cloud Costs

AWS SageMaker allows running models on specific hardware instance types, such as `ml.g5.2xlarge`. It's essential to be aware of the associated costs and quotas:

- It is common to have an applied default quota value of 0 for specific instance types on AWS.

- To enable them, you need to:

  1. Go to your AWS Console > Service Quotas.
  2. Navigate to AWS Services -> Amazon SageMaker -> Apply Quotas for specific instance types.
  3. Apply for the required quota. Please note, it can sometimes take over 1 day to get a quota approved.

- [Here's a link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/instance-types-az.html) to search for specific instance types used by a model, which you can apply quotas for. If you can't find the instance type for your model, and do not have a quota assigned, the CLI will display an error message with the exact instance type that needs an assigned quota value.

- For more information about the costs associated with SageMaker and the specific instance types, you can refer to the [AWS SageMaker Pricing Page](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/).

#### Requirements

- Registered AWS Account
- AWS IAM User Access Key
- AWS IAM User Secret Key
- AWS IAM User must have `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` permission policy assigned.
- AWS IAM Role ARN
- AWS IAM Role must have `AmazonSageMakerFullAccess` permission policy assigned.

Other popular cloud platforms are on our roadmap and will be supported soon. Stay tuned for updates, and don't hesitate to contribute or request support for your preferred platforms.
